Tutor4Kids is an innovative online tutoring platform designed to support children in their learning journey through personalized lessons and interactive experiences. The platform connects students with qualified tutors who specialize in a variety of subjects, helping them strengthen their understanding and build confidence in their studies.

The project features a React frontend that delivers a dynamic and user-friendly interface, allowing smooth navigation and real-time updates. On the server side, a Node.js backend handles data processing, authentication, and communication between users and the system. All information — including user profiles, class schedules, and learning progress — is securely stored and managed using a MySQL database.

Tutor4Kids emphasizes scalability, performance, and accessibility, making it a robust solution for both students and tutors. With future enhancements such as video chat integration, progress tracking, and gamified learning tools, the platform aims to create an engaging and supportive environment for young learners worldwide.
